        <p>
Welcome to the 8vb Music Production Music Library website (the "Site"), operated by 8vb Music ("we", "us", "our"). These terms and policies govern your access to and use of the Site and its services. By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and our Cookie Policy. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must not use the Site.
This Site provides access to a library of production music for auditioning and evaluation purposes. The actual use of any music downloaded or streamed from this Site in any production or public performance is strictly subject to the user holding appropriate licenses with their relevant performing rights organisations (PROs) and collection societies (e.g., MCPS/PRS in the UK, or equivalent bodies internationally) covering the use of production music libraries, and adhering to the reporting requirements of those organisations. <br>
</p>
        <h3>
Terms of Service
</h3>
        <p>
1. Acceptance of Terms<br><br>
By registering for an account, logging in, browsing, downloading evaluation files, or otherwise using the Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service.<br><br>
2. Service Description<br><br>
The Site provides authorised users (as defined in Section 3) with the ability to search, stream (playback), and download full-quality production music audio files ("Production Music Files") from our library. Access to download these Production Music Files is granted by us conditional upon the user confirming their status as an authorised licensee. The subsequent use of any downloaded Production Music Files within any audio-visual or audio-only production is subject to the user holding a valid, current license from their relevant national collection society or Performing Rights Organisation (PRO) (e.g., PRS for Music and MCPS in the UK, or equivalent international bodies) that explicitly covers the use of production music libraries. Users are solely responsible for:<br>
a. Ensuring they possess the necessary and appropriate licenses from their relevant PRO(s) before incorporating any Production Music Files into a production.<br>
b. Accurately reporting all usage of Production Music Files to their relevant PRO(s) in accordance with the terms of their license agreement(s) and the PRO's reporting procedures (e.g., submitting cue sheets).<br><br>
3. User Accounts & Authorised Access<br><br>
a. Access to certain features of the Site, including downloading Evaluation Files, requires registration and the issuance of login credentials (username and password).<br>
b. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process.<br>
c. You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and for any activities or actions under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your account.<br>
d. Access is granted solely to the registered individual or entity. Sharing or transferring login details to unauthorised third parties is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate termination of access.<br>
e. We reserve the right to refuse registration, suspend, or terminate accounts at our discretion, particularly in cases of suspected misuse or breach of these terms.<br><br>
4. Permitted Use<br><br>
You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Site and Evaluation Files strictly for the purpose of auditioning and evaluating music for potential licensing in your productions.<br><br>
5. Prohibited Uses<br><br>
You agree not to:<br>
a. Use any Production Music Files downloaded from the Site in any production unless you hold the necessary, valid licenses from your relevant PRO(s) covering such use, and unless you comply fully with the reporting requirements (e.g., cue sheets) mandated by those PROs and your license agreements.<br>
b. Redistribute, resell, sublicense, share, or otherwise make the Evaluation Files available to any third party.<br>
c. Use the Site or its content for any unlawful purpose.<br>
d. Attempt to circumvent any security measures, watermarking, or access restrictions.<br>
e. Modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any portion of the Site or the music files.<br>
f. Remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the Site or Evaluation Files.<br><br>
6. Intellectual Property Rights<br><br>
a. All music, audio recordings, compositions, text, graphics, logos, user interfaces, and other content on the Site ("Content") are the property of [Your Company Name], its licensors, or composers, and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws internationally (including under the Berne Convention).<br>
b. Your use of the Site grants you no ownership rights to any Content. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.<br>
c. While access and download are permitted for authorised users via this Site, the license permitting the use of the Production Music Files in productions is typically obtained via membership and appropriate blanket or specific licenses with your national collection society or PRO (e.g., MCPS/PRS). Users are responsible for confirming their license status and scope with their PRO. 8vb Music retains full copyright and ownership of the master recordings and underlying compositions available on this site. Further information on PRO licenses can be found by contacting your local collection society (e.g., MCPS/PRS). For further information on direct licensing options please contact us through the contact us form on our website. <br><br>
7. Disclaimers<br><br>
The Site and its Content are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Site will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.<br><br>
8. Limitation of Liability<br><br>
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, 8vb Music shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Site; (b) any unauthorised access to or use of our servers and/or any personal information stored therein.<br><br>

10. Changes to Terms<br><br>
We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. We will notify registered users of significant changes, typically via email or a notice on the Site. Your continued use of the Site after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.<br><br>
11. Contact Information<br><br>
